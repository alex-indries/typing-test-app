# Typing app

This app requires you to type the random sentence that is being generated using a lorem api. If you managed to type it correctly, a success message div will appear. 
This app is pretty straight forward also, you need to use these commands accordingly:
#npm install - to install dependencies

#npm start - to run the project

You also need to have angular cli installed.
